# Frontend General Instructions

This file is the default decision guide for client-side architecture choices.

## State Management Policy

### Current default
- Use Angular Signals in services/components for small-to-medium scoped state.
- Do **not** add Signal Store by default.

### When Signal Store is needed
Adopt Signal Store when at least one of these is true:

1. State is shared across multiple unrelated feature areas.
2. Update logic becomes duplicated across several services/components.
3. You need clear, centralized updaters/effects for async flows.
4. Selectors/computed derivations are becoming complex and repetitive.
5. Testing state transitions is difficult with the current structure.

### Decision checklist (quick)
- If 0-1 items above are true -> stay with service Signals.
- If 2+ items are true -> move to Signal Store.

## Current project decision
- For the current task workflow UI, existing Angular Signals in `TaskService` are sufficient.
- No immediate migration to Signal Store is required.
